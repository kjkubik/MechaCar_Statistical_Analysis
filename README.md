## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:
The coefficients providing a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are vehicle length and ground clearance.
The 
•	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
•	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
•	The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
## T-Test on Suspension Coils

The one-sample t-test is used to determine whether there is a statistical difference between the means of a sample dataset and a hypothesized, potential population dataset.

The first t-test performed is on the entire dataset. The resulting data from the t-test shows us a p-value of .06028. This p-value is above the normal statistical significance level of 5%. Therefore, the p-value indicates the null hypothesis cannot be rejected and the means are statistically similar.

The other t-tests performed are on each of the dataset's lot number subsets. 
The first and second lots, Lot1 and Lot2, each show a p-value agreeing with the entire dataset's results. 

It is not until we observe Lot3's resulting t-test that we are able ot  reis also over the number statistical significace levelof 5%.
